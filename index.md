Machine learning uses computers to run predictive models that learn from existing data in order to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

In this data science course, you will be given clear explanations of machine learning theory combined with practical scenarios and hands-on experience building, validating, and deploying machine learning models. You will learn how to build and derive insights from these models using R, Python, and Azure Machine Learning.
